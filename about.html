      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Rohan Roy Chowdhury</strong>, currently in my third year of studying Computer Science and Engineering (Data Science) at VIT Vellore. My journey in technology started with a simple curiosity: how can computers and data help us solve everyday problems and make life better for everyone?</p>
      <p>I believe that technology is not just about codeâ€”it's about people, creativity, and making a positive impact. Whether I'm analyzing data, building a new project, or learning a new skill, I always focus on how my work can help others and bring new ideas to life.</p>
      <ul class="about-highlights">
        <li><strong>Passionate Learner:</strong> I am always eager to explore new topics, from data analysis and machine learning to the latest trends in software development. I enjoy breaking down complex ideas into simple, understandable concepts.</li>
        <li><strong>Team Player:</strong> I love collaborating with people from different backgrounds. Working together, sharing ideas, and supporting each other is how the best solutions are created.</li>
        <li><strong>Curious and Creative:</strong> My curiosity drives me to experiment, ask questions, and find creative ways to solve problems. I believe every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow.</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusive Approach:</strong> I strive to make technology accessible and understandable for everyone, regardless of their background or experience level.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Looking ahead, I am excited to keep learning, take on new challenges, and contribute to projects that make a real difference. I hope to inspire others to discover the power of technology and to work together to build a brighter, more connected future.</p>
      <p>If you'd like to connect, collaborate, or just have a chat about technology, learning, or anything else, feel free to reach out. Let's create something amazing together!</p>
